## Scenario Overview

Scenario 1 has highest interconnectivity
  - 8 routers
Scenario 2 has lowest interconnectivity
  - 5 routers
  - However contact durations are longer than other scenarios because the routers are moving very slowly
Scenario 3 has medium interconnectivity
  - 8 routers
  - Similar to scenario 1, slightly different placement/paths/timing
