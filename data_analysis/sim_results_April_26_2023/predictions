TODO:
1. A major weakness of current IMPLEMENTATION of RDTN compared to SAW is that 
clients dont share with each other if they are in mutual connection range.

(Although in the stable configuration this shouldn't matter 
b/c clients will never be in mutual connection range)

Could be improved w/ one simple change:
- If 2 client agents are in connection range with each other,
  check if they have any payloads meant for each other. If so,
  move the payloads accordingly and update their metrics accordingly.

2. Another flaw of the current implementation of RDTN is that clients
ignore routers if they are in connection range, because
the reconnection interval is strictly followed
- This could be relaxed by handshaking whenever in mutual connection with a router
- This would avoid situations where a client is in connection range w/
a router that has bundles for it, but ignores the router and loses the opportunity
to receive its bundles.

Success:
1. epidemic

    Epidemic spreads bundles as much as it can, so a destination should be found
    more often than the more conservattive propagation methods.
    
    Additionally, in Epidemic, all nodes are able to help propagate bundles,
    including clients.

2. Roaming DTN

    Roaming DTN is similar to spray-and-wait because it waits for host router mappings
    and generates K number of bundles for each of the available hosts.

    However, RDTN's bundles will propagate throughout the network, while SAW's
    bundles will only propagate at most 1 hops.

    A fundamental downside of RDTN compared to Epidemic/SAW
    is that only routers will help propagate bundles.
    Clients do not help propagate/forward bundles.

    A con of RDTN is that the CGR being performed is only an approximation, 
    and can be inaccurate.
    
3. Spray-and-Wait

    Spray-and-wait generates maximum K bundles per payload, and then propagates
    those bundles only 1 hop. 

    A pro of SAW is that everyone is able to help out, including clients.
    Pro/con: bundles stay in one place until they get picked up, 
        like a lost child being told to stay in one place instead of moving everywhere.
