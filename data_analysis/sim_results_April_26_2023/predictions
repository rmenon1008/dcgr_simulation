Success:
1. epidemic

    Epidemic spreads bundles as much as it can, so a destination should be found
    more often than the more conservattive propagation methods.
    
    Additionally, in Epidemic, all nodes are able to help propagate bundles,
    including clients.

2. Roaming DTN

    Roaming DTN is similar to spray-and-wait because it waits for host router mappings
    and generates K number of bundles for each of the available hosts.

    However, RDTN's bundles will propagate throughout the network, while SAW's
    bundles will only propagate at most 1 hops.

    A fundamental downside of RDTN compared to Epidemic/SAW
    is that only routers will help propagate bundles.
    Clients do not help propagate/forward bundles.

    A con of RDTN is that the CGR being performed is only an approximation, 
    and can be inaccurate.
    
3. Spray-and-Wait

    Spray-and-wait generates maximum K bundles per payload, and then propagates
    those bundles only 1 hop. 

    A pro of SAW is that everyone is able to help out, including clients.
    Pro/con: bundles stay in one place until they get picked up, 
        like a lost child being told to stay in one place instead of moving everywhere.
