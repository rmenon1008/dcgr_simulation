"""
Contains the SprayAndWait class, which implements the "Spray-and-Wait" algorithm with Bundle expiration.

This algorithm has two parts:
- spray:  the node creates the bundle + sends it out to a random set of N nearby nodes.
- wait:  the N nodes which receive the bundle store it.  they then wait to actually run into the recipient node.
         once they run into the intended recipient node, they pass it on.
